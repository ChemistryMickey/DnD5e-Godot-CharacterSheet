# DnD5e-Godot-CharacterSheet
A character sheet helper for Dungeons and Dragons 5e written in GDScript using the Godot 3.x game engine.

Only tested using Arcane Trickster Rogue and Warlock.
Possibly not flexible enough for something like homebrewed classes. 
Also doesn't support multi-classing.

Hotkeys:
- Escape to open available options
- CTRL+S to save (causes a gentle flash of white for feedback)
- CTRL+L to load a character sheet
- CTRL+T to open an additional scratch work popup (in addition to the additional scratch work tab)

(This was my first attempt at a UI using Godot so I apologize for the structure and quality)
